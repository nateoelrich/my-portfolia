        Before I was a software engineer, I was a poor kid, high school dropout, and a cold caller getting chewed out for minimum wage. Hitting my rock bottom at 17 years old
        was the catalyst I needed to get an education and turn my life around. Without any support from my family, I earned my GED, worked multiple jobs, and eventually enrolled in
        Clover Park Technical College to study Software Development. While there, I began my training as a leader in student government and since entering the workforce in 2013, 
        I've built a successful career in software as a well-rounded professional. I continued my education through self-study, online courses, and obtaining my BA in IT-Software Development 
        from Western Governors University in 2018.

        Throughout my career, I've worked with many different types of companies, technologies, and people. I've been in the private sector most recently, but my career started
        with a local regional agency. Most of my experience has been creating web-based solutions, but I've become proficient in both frontend and backend development, allowing me to 
        build software that delivers the best products for the business and those using it. My focus is understanding the product and the users who use them in order to create
        the most valuable solutions.

        My passion has always been to make a positive impact in the lives of others with the work that I do and the people I work with. Technology has the power to change lives and improve the world, and I recognize
        my role in that as a software engineer. Being a leader means helping others grow and succeed, and I take that responsibility seriously. I'm committed to the success of those 
        around me, because I understand that in order to truly succeed, we must lift others up along the way.
